\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
{\ttfamily barry} includes a flexible way to generate counters based on change statistics. Since most of the time we are counting many motifs in a graph, change statistics make a reasonable (and efficient) way to make such counts.

In particular, let the motif be defined as $s(y)$, with $y$ as the binary array. The change statistic when adding cell $y_{ij}$, i.\+e. when the cell moves from being emty to have a one, is defined as

\[ \delta(y_{ij}) = s^+_{ij}(y) - s^-_{ij}(y), \]

where $s^+_{ij}(y)$ and $s^-_{ij}(y)$ represent the motif statistic with and without the ij-\/cell. For example, in the case of networks, the change statistic for the number of edges is always 1.

To count statistics in an array, the \mbox{[}\mbox{\hyperlink{class_counter}{Counter}}\mbox{]} class will empty the array, initialize the counters, and then start counting while adding at each step a single cell, until matching the original array.
